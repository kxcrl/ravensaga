Ravensaga is a game about characters on a journey through a quiet and dangerous world.

As one of them, you will watch its deep red sun loll across its forested horizon.

You will walk the alleys of its forlorn cities and barter with the suspicious racketeers that haunt them.

You will be tempted by the power of its buried secrets and upon their touch your body will twist with their corruption.

You will build a mycelium sanctuary in a wide, shaded field from whose vine stalks will swing the playful denizens you've created a hopeful home for.

When you are lost to its labyrinths, they will tell your story and recover your lost works and mark upon the soil a proper place for your memory.

- If you're new to roleplaying games, take a moment to watch the exemplary old guard at [3d6 Down the Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL0rYJw-Q9M&list=PLtBYin1uOBmCs1hSQQqxesYPbod7Y5Cfq) to see what you're in for.
- If you're ready to play, create a character.
- If you're very versed in adventure games and you want to know what's different here:
1. Fighting is no more special than any other skill. A single d20 roll for hit and damage all at once. There is no separate game for combat.
2. There are no classes. Anyone can learn anything (if they can find it). Attributes can make learning some things easier.
3. There is no magic. There is something else in its place. Faster, more powerful, much more deadly to touch.
4. There is a comprehensive alchemy system that properly supports a world littered with elixirs.
5. Everything is fully compatible with Old School Essentials while maintaining the New School spirit of fast, light games.
