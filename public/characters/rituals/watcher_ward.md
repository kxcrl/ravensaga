## Watcher Ward
_Looked upon,_  
_Meet their gaze_

**Requirements**  
An unbroken perimeter, laid with any single substance  
Symbols written just within it, all eyes

**Vessel**  
Any

If any look within the circle, by mundane means or otherwise, the Vessel will indicate it--
Water boils, dolls stand, tops spin, stones jump
