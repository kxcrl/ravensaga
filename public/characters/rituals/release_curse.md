## Release Curse
_This hatred has been bound here long enough_

**Requirements**  
Knowledge of the curse to be removed (identified by a mystic or sage)  
Holy water, one vial

**Vessel**  
A single item of solid gold (20 coins worth)

The holy water must be poured slowly, so as to flow over the cursed item throughout the ritual's duration.  
The gold will slowly shift, losing its luster, transmuting to silver.  
At the ritual's end, if the curse was properly identified, it will cease.  
Any effects that were a result of the curse stop.
