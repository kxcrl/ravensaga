<h1>Traits</h1>
<p>
<em>
  The advantages and burdens that each carry through their journey.
</em>
<br>
You have them or you donâ€™t.
<br>
They may be gained through great and terrible deeds and only shed through the same.
<br>
They have no cost and are added or removed from characters entirely through their interaction with the fiction.
