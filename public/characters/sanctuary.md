# Sanctuary

_A space for the wayward._  
_Tucked away between the planes._  
_A forgotten building in a city built too quickly._  
_A doorway to every corner of the world._

You may start with it, build it, find it, or win it in battle, but your party has a place that belongs solely to them.

It may be expanded in a number of ways that benefit you and the community you serve.

And one of you, or someone who was already here, knows how to bind it to places far away.  
With the right materials and a day of ritual, you can create a two way door that connects it directly to any other point, anywhere.  
Place it carefully. The doorway is as visible as any other. Anyone may walk through.
