## Storied Memory

_The world was not given to you through writing, but by voice, campfire, and fable._  
_You remember all that you are told and much of what you perceive._

If something was relayed to you in conversation, you may at any time have the GM repeat it to you in full detail.  
For any other past event that you were present for, test Cunning to recall it.  
Inebriation or a Persuasive person telling you different details may inhibit this.
