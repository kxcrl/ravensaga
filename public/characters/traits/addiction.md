## Addiction

_A single thing fills your mind. In comparison, all else is bland._  
_There is nothing you would rather hold_  
_in your hands, in your sight._  
_Your will to do anything other than acquire it wanes._  

-1 to all attributes on the first day without the object or activity.  
This increases each day (-2, -3) to -5, then decreases each day (-4, -3).  
If it is offered to you, a Resolute check is required to decline it.  
Once back to 0, remove this trait.

Be warned, some things will do this in weeks, not days.
