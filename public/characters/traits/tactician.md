## Tactician

_All just pawns upon the board, lost in the drama of the moment_  
_Seen from afar, their actions couldn't be more obvious_  

Provided you see the conflict coming ahead of time or otherwise have the opportunity to prepare, you may use Cunning instead of Quick to determine your initiative during Segmented events.
