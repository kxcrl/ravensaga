## Pursued

_Each day they toil in the courts, scrubbing their honor to a blinding polish._
_Few enemies would seethe more at your slights._

Any critical failure may be the result of the tireless working of those who have devoted their lives to ending yours.  
Obstacles placed by them or characters in their service.  
If so, the rest of the scene will be their attempt to finish the job.
