<h1>Items</h1>

<p>
<em>
The mediums of every act to come.
</em>
<br>
</p>

<p>
The many things that fill a backpack, are gripped in a hand, or rest upon the body.
<br>
The amount that can be carried is determined by how Strong a character is, a base of 13 available slots with 1 more for every 2 points of strength above 3.
<br>
As these slots fill, movement speed slows.
<br>
A sack carried in two hands may double the available slots.
<br>
Carried in one hand, it grants half as much.
<br>
Packed items require a turn to dig out.
<br>
Equipped items are available at a moment's notice, but only so many scabbards and quivers can be strapped to the body without causing a burden of their own.
