<h1>Abilities</h1>

<p>
<em>
  That which almost none can do, shared only by those that dedicate their lives.
</em>
<br>
Rare, reality bending capacities that can destroy a character just through the attempt to gain them.
<br>
Their use often invites corruption.
<br>
They are learned from secret orders, ancient tomes, and lost artifacts.
<br>
The xp cost is 10 * the ability Rank and is often much higher than most skills.
