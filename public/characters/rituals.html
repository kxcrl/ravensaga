<h1>Rituals</h1>

<p>
<em>
The sacred arts by whose careful application the world may be changed from afar.
</em>
<br>

If known, can be performed over the course of an hour, requiring absolute concentration and the sacrifice of many different components.
<br>
If on a scroll, can be performed once, destroying the scroll.
