_You've known no other._

**Rank:** III

**Range:** Any creature looking at the mystic

The creature must pass a Resolute check or have their will superseded.  
For every point spent beyond the initial cost, a -1 obstacle may be added.  
They will regard the caster as their trusted friend and ally.  
If they share a language, they may be commanded, but they will not engage in any act that harms or endangers them.

If the caster sleeps, unless they pay the ability cost a second time, the subject attempts to save vs Spell.  
Should they succeed, the effects fade.
