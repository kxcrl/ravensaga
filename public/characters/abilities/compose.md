## Compose
_Draw upon the fundamental world_  
_Direct it at your will_

**Rank:** I  
**Cost:** Corruption, special
**Range:** Visible  
**Known By**: Sorcerers, Wizards

The mystic creates a free form composition of distortion.  

The mystic declares the intent to start composing and chooses an element of their composition.  
At the end of the round, they may release it or continue composing.

If it is released, all effects in the composition apply at once.  
If they continue, they take 1d2 corruption and make a Resolute check.  
On success, they may choose a new element, rolling any necessary dice to determine the effect to come.  
On failure, the composition bursts, violently applying to the entire area and everyone in it.  
If the composition contained 3 or more elements, the area destabilizes.

**Element**             |  **Base Effect**
Acid                | 1d4 immediate damage, corrodes or dissolves anything affected
Echo                | Happens twice
Ethereality         | Merely appears to occur, has no effect beyond being convincingly visible

Fire                | 1d6 immediate heat damage, ignites anything flammable
Force               | Pushes or pulls up to d100 kg
Ice                 | 1d6 immediate cold damage, freezes anything liquid
Magnification       | Doubles all effects
Restricted Medium   | Travels through or applies to a specific medium (air, water, stone, blood)
Specificity         | Affects only areas or subjects with a simple condition (visible, touched, lit, present)
Spread              | Affects a 1d10' area
Solidity            | Occupies a simple geometric defined space, 1d2' in cubic volume
Water               | Flows, splashes, behaves as liquid
