_Floating by your side_  
_Coiled, yearning to be loosed_

**Range:** 3'  
**Known By**: Sorcerers

An arrow floats from its quiver and hovers by the practitioner's side

Until the arrow has been released, the Corruption for it cannot be healed  
There is no limit to how many may be held or used at once, otherwise
