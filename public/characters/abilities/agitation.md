**Rank:** II  
**Cost:** Corruption, 1 per round, cm diameter, and 1' of distance   
**Range:** Any visible object  
**Known By**: Theurgs, Witches

Under the mystic's gaze, a small area begins to heat.  
After a single round, it becomes warm to the touch.  
After additional rounds, the following occurs:  
2: Metal warms, wood and cloth spark, paper ignites  
3: Metal softens, wood and cloth ignite  
4: Metal melts  
5: Metal ignites

An unarmored person under this gaze would take 1 damage the first round, 2 the second, 4 the third, and so on.

Anything that blocks or interrupts the gaze of the mystic halts the process.  
Objects take double the amount of time spent heating them to return to their previous temperature.  
(1 round of heating -> 2 rounds of cooling)
