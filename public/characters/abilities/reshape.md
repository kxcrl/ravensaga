## Reshape
_Let its form become unbound_  
_Malleable beneath my fingers_

**Rank:** III  
**Cost:** Corruption, 1/round for every 10kg of object mass  
**Range:** Any visible object  
**Known By**: Sorcerers, Witches

A single inanimate object acts like clay in the hands of the mystic, stretching and bending in the distance under the motions of their hands.  
It can be reworked into a form up to double or as little as half of its original mass.

Finer work, such as smithing or sculpting, still requires the requisite skill to perform.  
The level of detail is limited to what can be reasonably formed by hand.  
Sensitive mechanisms will break immediately. Locks become solid objects, traps go off and then cannot be reset.
