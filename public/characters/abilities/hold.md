## Hold
_Where it sits, let it be bound._  
_A permanence in the air, immutable._

**Rank:** II  
**Cost:** Corruption, 1 for every 1' of object size  
**Range:** Any visible object  
**Known By**: Theurgs, Witches

Looking at an object, the mystic makes a fist with an empty hand.  
As long as their fist remains closed, nothing may lift, rotate, or otherwise move the object.  
This includes any form of damage.

Should something attempt to do, the mystic must pass a Resolute check or again suffer the ability cost.  
If they do not or cannot, the object responds as normal.
