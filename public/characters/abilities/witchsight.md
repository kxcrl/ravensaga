## Witchsight
_Attune your soul to the flow of distortion, let it wash within you, see the world's shadow._  

**Rank:** I  
**Cost**: Corruption, 1d3/turn  
**Known By**: Sorcerers, Wizards, Witches, any who sacrifice themselves to a dark god  

By attuning themselves to the lower world, a prismatic dance of light radiates across whatever is being viewed, revealing its shadow.  
The deep reds and browns of living creatures, verdant greens of nature, silver and gold of mineral and machine.  
So, too, by contrast, are those things visible which do not shed light. Thick, oil dripping silhouettes that consume all radiance around them. Darkness and death.

Opening themselves to this is not without great risk.  
The practitioner is flooded with 1d3 corruption for each turn they spend viewing the world in this way.
