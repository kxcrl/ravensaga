## Stitch
_Woven together, fibers of being, as one._

**Rank:** II  
**Cost:** Corruption, 1d4  
**Range:** Visible  
**Known By**: Witches

The mystic spreads their arms wide, pulls them together, and interlocks the fingers of their empty hands.  
Any two adjacent objects blend into a seamless, gradient whole.  
They must be roughly the size of the caster or smaller or the ability cost is doubled (or tripled for truly large things).

Objects that have memory of one another reform as before, if able.

Damage done by most weapons can be undone completely, though most elemental effects, especially fire, acid, or poison, cannot be reversed this way.
