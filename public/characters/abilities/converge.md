Remove all distortion from an area.

If the mystic is aware that a character is about to use an ability, this would be able to prevent it from taking effect.  
This would not, however, halt any currently in progress ritual or ongoing ability or undo its effects, though it will provide a single round of protection from it.  
Additionally, corrupted items, as generators of distortion, would only become mundane for a single round.  
This would be enough to escape a curse, but not to break it.  
The ongoing effects of a previously finished ritual or ability will be halted.
