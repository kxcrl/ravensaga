# Options

**Improvement with Practice**  
When making a skill check, if the character succeeds by rolling a 1, they may spend 10xp to immediately improve the skill.

**Improvement by Affinity**  
For every 5 skills a player possesses that all have the same primary attribute, they may improve that attribute by 1.  
It is recommended in this case to remove the Attribute Focus ability from the game.

**Grappling**  
If a character dives onto, tackles, lands on, or otherwise wrestles with a character that's within range of them, they initiate a grapple.  
While grappling, a character may only attack the person they are currently grappling, and only using fists or small weapons (daggers, darts, arrows, etc).  
Neither character may move unless they break the grapple. To do so requires a Strong check ± the opposing character's Strong mod. On either success or failure, the opposing character gets a free attack.  
If attacking from the outside, characters do not miss unless they roll a 19 or 20. Instead, points above the target number inflict damage on the other character currently being grappled. If there is more than one, choose from among them at random.  
For all abilities, the characters in the grapple count as a single target.

**Predisposition**  
Since attributes quantify a character's backstory and their history with certain types of activities, a character might quickly pick up the basics of the things if they've had similar experiences.  
Things they have no experience with would be more difficult.  
The first level of each skill is 10xp ± the modifier of its primary attribute.  
Subsequent levels are 10xp, as normal.

**Unaware Skill Checks**  
Occasionally, just rolling a skill check will give the player information as if it had succeeded. For instance, a player moves into a room and has to see if they are moving silently or hidden by shadows or is able to detect nearby traps.  
To keep things more surprising, the GM may make these rolls in secret as the players are moving and only share the results if there is a consequence.

**Hirelings and Retainers**  
Characters may bring a number of NPCs with them on their adventure equal to or less than their Persuasive mod.  
They must agree to a price that the Retainer will be paid daily, and the Retainer must be paid each day.  
Each will have a Loyalty score, ranging from 1 to 10. In the case of a hired professional, this can be set to 5. If the first encounter is in the wild, roll a 1d10 to determine their Loyalty.  
Anytime the character does something that the Retainer dislikes, lower it by one. If it is less than six, roll a 1d6. If the result is equal to or less than their Loyalty score, they will voice their disapproval, but will continue to follow the character. Otherwise, they will leave. This doesn't mean they will turn against the character, only that they will stop actively following them and go their own way.  
Treating the Retainer especially well, offering them a portion of treasure, or increasing their pay rate may each raise the Loyalty score by 1 and require a failed Loyalty check to be re-rolled. However, better options for these actions will likely emerge in the fiction.

**Exploration Experience**  
If you intend to spend a large amount of time in a dangerous area, or one where clever actions take precedence over more social role playing, you may use the following list to continue granting XP during the session.  
Each item listed is intended to grant 2XP, though you may reduce this to 1XP if it is unusually minor (unlocking a chest), or raise it to 5XP if it is uniquely risky or dramatic (overcoming a dungeon's greatest obstacle).

\- Escape a trap unscathed  
\- Discover a location of historical significance  
\- Fulfill a promise of action made to an NPC  
\- Prove (or disprove) an NPC's story  
\- Find something secret or intentionally hidden  
\- Reveal the meaning or purpose of a significant location or item  
\- Convince an NPC to act in your benefit  
\- Bargain with an NPC to gain an advantage or reveal an insight  
\- Explore a distinct, previously unknown level or area (at least a few rooms beyond the entrance)  
\- Camp safely through a night (or other period of several hours)  
\- Overcome a significant danger in the environment (weather or conditions)  
\- Successfully use an item in an unintended or unorthodox way to accomplish a task

**Spirit of Cooperation**  
If you or your group wish to foster a less competitive environment, you may step down the amount of XP gained in a situation and award it to all players present instead of one.  
For example, instead of awarding 2XP to the single character who accomplished it, an action awards 1XP to all characters present. (Or 2XP to all characters instead of 5XP.)  
You may also use this only on occasion instead of replacing single character rewards entirely. For example, a situation where one character is taking the lead, but multiple characters participate in the actions to follow.

**Mutative Corruption**  
Instead of dealing damage to HP when a character fails their Resolute check, you may take the failure amount, add it to the total of their current temporary and permanent corruption, then roll a 1d4 and consult the following table.

--  | 1 - Senses    | 2 - Body    | 3 - Mind     | 4 - Shadow
<10 | -1d4 Vigilant | -1d4 Strong | -1d4 Cunning | -1d4 Resolute
11  | Blind to normal color. Can see kaleidoscopes across the infrared. -5 accurate handling anything that doesn't give off heat. Can see heat signatures even in total darkness. | ... | ... | ...
12  | ... | Body withers. -2 max Strong. | ... | ...
13  | ... | ... | ... | ...
14  | ... | ... | ... | ...
15  | ... | ... | ... | ...
16  | ... | Combust. 1d6 damage per turn until extinguished. All flammable equipment burns. | ... | ...
17  | ... | ... | Gain a random ability. Lose all unspent XP. | ...
18  | ... | Reassembled. Swap two attributes.<br />1d8 to determine (reroll on match) | Cascading loss. Roll 1d6 for each skill and ability.<br />On 3 or less, remove it. | ...
19  | Sharpened by nightmares. 1d6 damage. Reroll Vigilant as 4d6 (max 18) | Reforged by warp. 1d6 damage. Add 1d6 to max Accurate, Discreet, Quick, or Strong (1d4 to determine). | Unwavering focus. 1d6 damage. +1 to max Cunning (max 18) | Reborn in darkness. Remove all corruption. Change Corruption Threshold equal to Resolute. If it is ever exceeded, permanently lose control of the character.
20+ | Incomprehensible. Reroll max Discreet and max Vigilant as 1d6. | Inversion. 1d20+10 damage.<br />Reroll Strong and Quick as 1d6 if survived. | Shatter. Reroll Cunning and Resolute as 1d6. | Dissolution. Character dies.

**Area Destabilization**  
If more than 20 points of Corruption are spent by characters and NPCs in an area, the excessive distortion destabilizes it.  
Roll d100 and consult the following table.

\# | Result        | Effect
BL | Bleed         | Anything within slowly leaks without. Chests pour contents, packs drop items (1d4/round), plants drip water, characters lose blood (1d4 damage).
CO | Combustion    | Each round a random object begins to smoke. Unless removed from the area, it ignites in the next.
CO | Command       | Each character must make a RES check. Those who fail become enthralled to those who passed until they leave the area.
CO | Conflagration | Erupting in to violent flame, everything in the room is consumed. 1d4 rounds of immense heat beforehand serves as warning.
DI | Dislocate     | An exit (or a cardinal direction, in an open area) leads somewhere else. It may still be entered as normal.
FI | Firestorm     | Like slow, thick droplets of rain, fire pools together and falls from above (2 damage per round, anything flammable burns).
FL | Flood         | The area is underwater. Maximum 10' height, 10' width. Stops at walls, ceilings, and portals. Forms a vertical wall of water in open spaces.
FR | Freeze        | In a flash, all is coated in ice. Characters must pass a STR check to break free.
GA | Gate          | A hole tears through space leading to a random nearby location.
GR | Gravity Well  | All weight increases dramatically. STR check at beginning of any segment or the character is pulled to the ground and spends the segment fighting to stand up.
LE | Lethargy      | Make a Resolute check to crawl at half speed. Otherwise, sleep for one round. No other action may be taken.
LI | Lightveins    | Bright, thin roots spread outward, marbling the air. The entire space is illuminated to an almost blinding degree, leaving no shadows. All things pass through them as if they were non-existent.
MA | Mass Mutation | Every living thing in the room rolls 1d20 and consults the Mutative Corruption table.
RE | Refraction    | Visual information swims and sways (-5 to anything relying on sight).
SH | Shatter       | As a ball through glass, part of a surface breaks away, leaving massive cracks spidering across every other surface. May open to neighboring rooms, floors, etc.
SI | Silent        | No sound can be made. Anything beyond may still be heard.
SO | Soak: Oil     | Precipitating like dew, a random mix of oils and fats coat every surface (slick, flammable).
SO | Soak: Water   | In an instant, the aftermath of a day long rainstorm. Fires are doused.
TH | Thunderstorm  | Thick fog fills the area, lightning strikes a random target each round (1d12 damage).
TI | Timewaves     | Each round, QUI is randomly halved or doubled. Reverse the effect if a character moves.
UN | Unmoor        | No longer bound by gravity, everyone and everything floats. Characters and objects may get stuck in open spaces if their momentum is halted.
VA | Vanish        | Everything in the area is invisible. Anything beyond may still be seen.
VI | Violent Wind  | Whipping in all directions, all light objects become projectiles (persistent, random target, 1d4 damage).
