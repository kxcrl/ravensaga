**Improvement by Affinity**  
For every 5 skills a player possesses that all have the same primary attribute, they may improve that attribute by 1.  
It is recommended in this case to remove the Attribute Focus ability from the game.

**Unaware Skill Checks**  
Occasionally, just rolling a skill check will give the player information as if it had succeeded. For instance, a player moves into a room and has to see if they are moving silently or hidden by shadows or is able to detect nearby traps.  
To keep things more surprising, the GM may make these rolls in secret as the players are moving and only share the results if there is a consequence.
