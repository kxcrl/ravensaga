  <h1>Ravensaga</h1>
  <p>An adventure game about characters on a journey through a quiet and dangerous world.</p>
  <p>As one of them, you will watch its deep red sun loll across its forested horizon.</p>
  <p>You will walk the alleys of its forlorn cities and barter with the suspicious racketeers that haunt them.</p>
  <p>You will be tempted by the power of its buried secrets and upon their touch your body will twist with their corruption.</p>
  <p>You will build a mycelium sanctuary in a wide, shaded field from whose vine stalks will swing the playful denizens you've created a hopeful home for.</p>
  <p>When you are lost to its labyrinths, they will tell your story and recover your works and mark upon the soil a proper place for your memory.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you're new to roleplaying games, take a moment to watch the exemplary old guard at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL0rYJw-Q9M&amp;list=PLtBYin1uOBmCs1hSQQqxesYPbod7Y5Cfq">3d6 Down the Line</a> to see what you're in for.<li>If you're ready to play, create a character.<li>If you're already well versed in adventure games and you want to know what's different here:<ol>
      <li>Fighting is no more special than any other skill. A single d20 roll for hit and damage all at once. There is no separate game for combat.<li>There are no classes. Anyone can learn anything (if they can find it). Attributes can make learning some things easier.<li>There is no Vancian magic. There is something else in its place. Faster, more powerful, much more deadly to touch.<li>There is a comprehensive alchemy system that properly supports a world littered with elixirs.<li>Everything is fully compatible with Old School Essentials while maintaining the New School spirit of fast, light games.</ol>
  </ul>
