# Death

If HP is reduced to 0 or less, damage is subtracted from Strength  
Afterward, a Strength check must be made  
If succeeded, the character perseveres  
If failed, the character is dying  
They can no longer take actions  
They lose 1 point of Strength at the end of each round  
Any additional damage is subtracted from Strength  
If their Strength reaches 0, they are dead

A player should immediately make a new character.  
This new character should enter the next scene as expediently as possible, in whatever way makes even a small amount of sense.  
You are encouraged to disregard any need for realism in this case.
