# Journeying
- Between moments of Open exploration or Segmented action, hours or even an entire day may pass with only a few important things being narrated.
- Traveling long distances, crafting complex items, studying, training, or other periods where the actions of the characters do not vary during them should be passed over as montages.
- This will cause the quickest depletion of supplies, as well as the greatest number of potential encounters with any wandering danger that may be in the area. The GM should be sure to track and roll for both. 
- If there is any possibility of a situation requiring attention or careful interaction, no matter how small, the montage should stop.

# Open

- The most common speed of play, actions here are described as turns, with anyone acting in any order.
- A turn describes 10 minutes of game time.
- After every few turns, the GM should mark off one turn on their sheet and let the Players know that a turn has passed.
- The GM should also be sure to mark off torches, check for wandering encounters, or advance anything else that may be taking place in the background.

# Segmented
In situations of high danger or drama, every second counts.

- If a trap is unleashed, a weapon swung, an accusation made, or any other significant event where each moment could change the outcome of a scene, the GM should announce that they are **stopping the clock**.
- Each character will then be able to take one action, referred to as a **Segment**.
- All segments together compose a round.
- Segment order is determined by how Quick each character is, with higher values going first.
- Each player should declare their intention at the beginning of the round, which may add or subtract from their Quick value and may modify the order.

Mod | Action          | Description
----|-----------------|------------
 \- | Assist          | Give advantage to an ally's action, skipping your segment
+3  | Ready           | Stand up, unpack an item, draw or reload a weapon, raise a shield
+3  | Hasty Action    | Quickly act with disadvantage
 0  | Dash            | Move at full movement rate
 0  | Recover         | Attempt to remove a negative status
 0  | Standard Action | Use any skill or perform any action as normal
-3  | Slow Action     | Use any skill or action requiring a large, heavy, two-handed, or slow object
-3  | Ability         | Use any ability

**Movement**  
If acting on any segment other than Dash, a character may also move a distance equal to their lowest movement speed as part of their action.

**Using Weaponry**  
Check Accurate Â± Defense to determine the target number  
Roll 1d20. Each point below the number is damage, up to the weapon's maximum.  
Above the target, the attack misses or fails to pierce the target's defense.  
Exactly equal to the target, the attack is a critical hit and deals the weapon's maximum, ignoring any mundane defense.  

**Shields and Helmets**  
A shield provides 1 defense and may be discarded (destroyed) to negate a single attack
A helmet provides no defense, but may be discarded to negate a deadly attack

**Moving in Range**  
If anything moves in range of a combatant, they can choose to make a free hasty attack, but they forfeit their next action.  
This includes actions that may happen next round if they have already acted.

**Waiting**  
A character can choose to wait and act later in the current segment or in a later segment

**Down**  
If a character takes more damage than their Pain Threshold in a single strike, they are Down and must Ready as their next action

**Ties for Segment Order**  
First, whoever is Quickest  
If Quick is tied, then whoever is most Vigilant  
If Vigilant is also tied, then whoever is most Discrete  
If Discrete is also tied, choose at random
