# Hirelings and Retainers

Characters may bring a number of NPCs with them on their adventure equal to or less than their Persuasive mod.  
They must agree to a price that the Retainer will be paid daily, and the Retainer must be paid each day.  
Each will have a Loyalty score, ranging from 1 to 10. In the case of a hired professional, this can be set to 5. If the first encounter is in the wild, roll a 1d10 to determine their Loyalty.  
Anytime the character does something that the Retainer dislikes, lower it by one. If it is less than six, roll a 1d6. If the result is equal to or less than their Loyalty score, they will voice their disapproval, but will continue to follow the character. Otherwise, they will leave. This doesn't mean they will turn against the character, only that they will stop actively following them and go their own way.  
Treating the Retainer especially well, offering them a portion of treasure, or increasing their pay rate may each raise the Loyalty score by 1 and require a failed Loyalty check to be re-rolled. However, better options for these actions will likely emerge in the fiction.
