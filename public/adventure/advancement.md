# Advancement

**Gaining XP**  
Characters gain XP at the end of each session based on how well they roleplay their [Convictions](/characters/convictions).

**Spending XP**  
Characters may learn new skills and abilities from anyone in the world that has the knowledge and is willing to train them.  
NPCs cannot train beyond their own level.  
Training typically costs 10t per skill level or ability rank.  
It requires one week per skill level or ability rank to be gained.  
For example, it takes one week to go from level 4 to level 5 for a skill, but a Rank IV ability takes 4 weeks to learn.

**Improvement with Practice**  
When making a skill check, if the character succeeds by rolling a 1, they may spend 10xp to immediately improve the skill.

**Predisposition**  
Since attributes quantify a character's backstory and their history with certain types of activities, a character might quickly pick up the basics of the things if they've had similar experiences.  
Things they have no experience with would be more difficult.  
The first level of each skill is 10xp Â± the modifier of its primary attribute.  
Subsequent levels are 10xp, as normal.

**Exploration Experience**  
If you intend to spend a large amount of time in a dangerous area, or one where clever actions take precedence over more social role playing, you may use the following list to continue granting XP at the end of each session.  
Each item listed is intended to grant 2XP, though you may reduce this to 1XP if it is unusually minor (unlocking a chest), or raise it to 5XP if it is uniquely risky or dramatic (overcoming a dungeon's greatest obstacle).

\- Escape a trap unscathed  
\- Discover a location of historical significance  
\- Fulfill a promise of action made to an NPC  
\- Prove (or disprove) an NPC's story  
\- Find something secret or intentionally hidden  
\- Reveal the meaning or purpose of a significant location or item  
\- Convince an NPC to act in your benefit  
\- Bargain with an NPC to gain an advantage or reveal an insight  
\- Explore a distinct, previously unknown level or area (at least a few rooms beyond the entrance)  
\- Camp safely through a night (or other period of several hours)  
\- Overcome a significant danger in the environment (weather or conditions)  
\- Successfully use an item in an unintended or unorthodox way to accomplish a task

**Spirit of Cooperation**  
If you or your group wish to foster a less competitive environment, you may step down the amount of XP gained in a situation and award it to all players present instead of one.  
For example, instead of awarding 2XP to the single character who accomplished it, an action awards 1XP to all characters present. (Or 2XP to all characters instead of 5XP.)  
You may also use this only on occasion instead of replacing single character rewards entirely. For example, a situation where one character is taking the lead, but multiple characters participate in the actions to follow.
