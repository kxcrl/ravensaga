- The most common speed of play, actions here are described as turns, with anyone acting in any order.
- A turn describes 10 minutes of game time.
- After every few turns, the GM should mark off one turn on their sheet and let the Players know that a turn has passed.
- The GM should also be sure to mark off torches, check for wandering encounters, or advance anything else that may be taking place in the background.
