# Abilities

_That which almost none can do, shared only by those that dedicate their lives._  
Rare, reality bending capacities that can destroy a character just through the attempt to gain them.  
Their use often invites corruption.  
They are learned from secret orders, ancient tomes, and lost artifacts.  
The xp cost is 10 * the ability Rank and is often much higher than most skills.


## Mysticism & the Occult

_Casting requires a vessel for power drawn from the world._  
_A vehicle, attuned to the flux._

_Oil, salt, blood, metals, and gems may all be bent to this purpose, each in their own way._  
_They must be coordinated exactly._  
_Any surface can be used, if it is flat and still._  
_With enough precision, they may even be laid into the fibers of a thick canvas._  
_It would have to be large, to be unrolled across the same area._

_By ritual, the vessels are drawn into alignment._  
_By will of the practitioner, they are bent to a purpose._  
_Ink shifts, blood boils, salt chars, metal tarnishes, oil smokes, gems crack and shatter._  
_All become ash._  
_The air shimmers, hotter or colder than before._  
_The world changes._


_For those that desire a closer connection to the source, the trades of Sorcery, Wizardry, Witchcraft, and Theurgy may teach you to become that vessel._  
_To drink true, raw power, sliding thick across your tongue._  
_To cast aside worried preparations and magics at a safe distance._

_To bend all at the speed of your desire._

_Protect the gem of your heart, vessel._  
_Careful that you, too, are not consumed._
