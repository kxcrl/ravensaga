## Reagents

Name           | Description    | Cost (Purity)
Spirit of Wood | A colorless liquid, scented like a weak rum. Destructively distilled from the wood of any tree.<br />The cheapest and easiest to obtain. Less effective than Aqua Ragia, but only mildly poisonous. | 1: 1s<br />2: 1t<br />3: 5t
Aqua Ragia     | An amber colored liquid, with a pungent cadaver scent. It can be distilled from the resin of nearly any pine tree, though yields vary greatly between species. The resin is collected by making shallow diagonal cuts, resembling the whiskers of a cat. Moderate in both price and difficulty to make. Very poisonous if mishandled, always impure. | 2: 8s<br />3: 4t<br />4: 10t
Aqua Vitae     | A colorless liquid, scented like a strong alcohol. Distilled most commonly from wine, but other drinking spirits may be used. Finer spirits result in greater purity. Expensive to begin with, but becomes dramatically moreso as purity increases. The most effective solvent and the only one able to reach full purity. Harmless when handled. | 4: 20t<br />5: 50t<br />6: 100t
Aqua Fortis    | Used most readily for creating shock- and thermally- sensitive explosives. Can be added to any alchemical mixture to create a blast effect. As the pure version is too reactive and the impure version is just as effective, purity is no obstacle. | 6: 50t
Spirit of Hartshorn | Isolated from volcanic salts. Will dissolve most metals to produce a conductive liquid. | 6: 50t
Spirit of Salt | Made by mixing Oil of Vitriol and table salt. Treats leather, descales metal, and cleans mortar from brickwork. Relatively safe to handle, despite its high acidity. | 6: 3s
Oil of Vitriol | Byproduct of burned oils. An excellent solvent, but its high reactivity gives it a 5 in 6 chance to destroy whatever is dissolved within it. | 6: 1s
Aqua Regia | Alchemy's most prized achievement, a liquid that can dissolve gold.<br />Will also dissolve platinum, but much more slowly. Does not dissolve other metals.<br />Made of 1 part Aqua Fortis to 3 parts Spirit of Salt.<br />Clear after mixing, but turns yellow, then orange, then red within seconds.<br />Decomposes and loses all effectiveness within an hour if not stored properly, or after a week in perfect conditions.<br />Any magical item dissolved this way produces a greater activator. | 6: 100t
