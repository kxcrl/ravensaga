## Distortion

## Scrolls
Scrolls are large canvases, usually a 5' square or more, that contain an entire Ritual pressed into their surface, fully prepared.  
The vessel for the ritual is embedded into them, usually in the center, often ground into a powder or paste.  
Words that need to be spoken are written, motions that need to be made are described or illustrated.  
Any other requirements are sewn patchwork into the surface.  
Unless they are written in some way that their instruction is obscured, any character may unroll them, stand in the center, and use them to cast a ritual in a single round.  
As they do, the vessel in the scroll is consumed, along with the materials, destroying most or all of the canvas in the process.
