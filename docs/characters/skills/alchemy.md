## Alchemy

**Society:** All in some form

All matter may be separated.
If separated, it may be concentrated.
If concentrated, it may be amplified.

The world is full of such elixirs.

To create them, you will need part of a plant containing the medicinal properties you wish to extract.

You will need a solvent. Its purity will matter.

Having performed your extraction, you will need an activator. Without this, the potion will have only a weak, medicinal effect. To mend flesh, defy reality, or command the elements, you must draw on occult knowledge.

Minor activators create minor potions. Most come from mystical remains or the detritus of ritual. The bones of a priest, the ash of a spent scroll. That any who walk an occult path create them by matter of course in their practice makes them not too difficult to find.

Greater activators create greater potions. Splinters of raw magic or shards of powerful corruption. The freshly shed scale of a mother Lindworm, the feasting web of an Etterherd cocoon.
They are not the prize of a successful hunt, but instead have been carefully borrowed from the ecosystem of something living, making them exceedingly rare.


Potions you create will have a known effect, based on their final purity. For example, a potion of cure light wounds may heal 3 toughness.

The same potion found in the wild will be unknown, so it will heal 1d6.

A merchant selling the same potion may have enough alchemy skill to guarantee at least a certain effectiveness. The same potion purchased from them may heal 1d6, minimum 3. This will be written as 1d6:3.

Determining this effectiveness requires a bit of math. The table of alchemical plants lists the maximum effect. At purity -5, you will achieve 5% of this. At -4, 10%. At -3, 20%. At -2, 50%. At -1, 75%. At 0, 100%.

Using a greater activator will triple the effect. A potion of cure serious wounds found in the wild will heal 3d6 toughness.
