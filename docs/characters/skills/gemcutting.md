## Gemcutting

**Society**: Human

Take an hour to improve the grade of a cut gem by one, to a maximum of the skill's value.  
On a failure, the gem is fractured and reduced to half its uncut value.

--| **Grade**      | **Value**
1 | Rough      | +10%
2 | Fair       | +25%
3 | Refined    | +50%
4 | Exquisite  | +75%
5 | Immaculate | +100%
