Looking at an object, the mystic makes a fist with an empty hand.  
As long as their fist remains closed, nothing may lift, rotate, or otherwise move the object.  
This includes any form of damage.  
Any attempt to do so requires the mystic to pass a Resolute check or again suffer the ability cost to continue.
