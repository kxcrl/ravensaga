## Animate
_Stay still, let it borrow your motion_

**Rank:** I  
**Cost:** Corruption, 1 for every 1' of object size and 1 for every turn  
**Range:** Touch  
**Known By**: Witches, Wizards

Standing motionless, the mystic touches an object and speaks a single command  
To the best of its ability, the object obeys the command  
They may bend, shift, roll, or walk, but cannot perform any non-mundane act, such as float or vanish

If the mystic acts or moves, the object ceases animating
