## Attribute Focus
_We still can remake ourselves_  
_As long as we breathe, there is time_

**Rank:** III  
**Cost:** None  
**Known By**: All

Raise the given attribute by 1 point.  
This may be taken multiple times.

Attribute Focus is the only ability that is not learned from another character through training with them.  
Instead, the character should visit someone who is very Strong, Accurate, Discrete, etc and at that time add the ability to their sheet.  
From then on, anytime they gain XP, they may choose to allocate some to it.  
Once it has 30 XP, it takes effect.

After it has been taken 5 times, the character must also subtract 1 from another attribute in order for it to take effect.

The trainer's attributes must be at least as high as the result of the ability to offer training.
