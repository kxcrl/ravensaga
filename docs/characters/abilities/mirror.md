## Mirror
_Meld into their motions_  
_Recite in repetition_

**Rank:** IV  
**Cost:** Corruption, special  
**Range:** Aware  
**Known By**: Sorcerers

By any means through which the practitioner may become aware of an ability being used, they may mimic it exactly.  
As it must be followed from the beginning, there is no way to know what it will be ahead of time.  
It occurs at the exact same time as the original.

The practitioner pays any costs, chooses any targets, and incurs any effects as if they had initiated the ability themselves.
