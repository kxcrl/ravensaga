## Sorcerer
_Accept that this path has only one end_  
_Embrace darkness, embrace power_

By choosing to accept and commune with distortion itself, you move more deeply within it, yet its hold over you loosens.  
Perhaps it knows it's only a matter of time.

Anytime temporary Corruption would become permanent, make a Resolute check.  
If successful, take only 1 point of permanent Corruption, instead.
