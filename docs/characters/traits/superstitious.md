## Superstitious

_Unable to explain what you witness, you descend into a frantic paranoia._

After any critical failure, receive -1 to all attributes.  
Remove if you critically succeed at any action.  
By spending an hour talking with you, other characters may check Persuasive Â± Resolute Mod to snap you out of it.
