# Items

_The mediums of every act to come._

The many things that fill a backpack, are gripped in a hand, or rest upon the body.  
The amount that can be carried is determined by how Strong a character is, a base of 13 available slots with 1 more for every 2 points of strength above 3.  
As these slots fill, movement speed slows.  
A sack carried in two hands may double the available slots.  
Carried in one hand, it grants half as much.  
Packed items require a turn to dig out.  
Equipped items are available at a moment's notice, but only so many scabbards and quivers can be strapped to the body without causing a burden of their own.
