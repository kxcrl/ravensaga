## Rite of Blood
_To the old ones, to that great darkness beyond_  
_I offer more of myself_  
_That you may come ever closer to me_

**Requirements**  
The character's blood  
A witch's circle inside a ring of solid gold (> 80 coins)

**Vessel**  
A source of distortion, whether item or area

As the mystic chants, the vessel dries.  
It is fed more and more of the mystic and offers itself in return.

The mystic reduces their max HP by Xd6 and increases their Resolution Threshold by the same amount.  
X, in this case, is determined by the mystic.  
After each roll, they may decide whether to do more or to stop and finish the ritual.  
If they fall unconscious, the spell fails and they heal as normal.

Both the gold and the vessel are consumed in the ritual, whether it succeeds or not.
