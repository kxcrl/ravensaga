## Shelter
_Pass over this place_  
_Leave it in my care this day_

**Requirements**  
Two fistfuls of anything that grows nearby, arranged carefully  
Several symbols representing Hearth and Holding, written into the ground

**Vessel**  
A hand carved offering, the length of a forearm

For twenty four hours, weather does not effect the area within the circle  
Rain and snow miss it in their descent, wind parts before reaching it  
The temperature matches the bodies of those within and becomes imperceptible
