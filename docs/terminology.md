# Terminology

You will need a **Game Master** (GM). A person who abides by the rules and remains entirely neutral in describing and adjudicating the game world. Though they carry great hope for the players at every step, they do nothing to sway fate, and allow the players to live and breathe in the game world as they will.

You will need at least one, and maybe many more **Players**. They will create characters and send them off to adventure in the game world. Those characters may attempt any action that can be imagined, and the Referee will describe the outcome of that attempt.

You will need, lastly, some dice, which use the following notation:

**d4**: a four-sided die

**d6**: a six-sided die

**d8**: an eight-sided die

**d10**: a ten-sided die

**d12**: a twelve-sided die

**d20**: a twenty-sided die

There are a few ways that these will be rolled in the game, described as follows:
- A roll using multiple dice. Written as a number before the notation above. For example, 3d6 means to roll three six-sided dice and sum the results.
- A modified roll. Written as a plus or minus after the dice roll. For example, 2d4+1 means to roll two four-sided dice, sum the results, and add 1.
- A percent roll. Written as d100, this uses two ten-sided dice read left to right. For example, a roll of a 4 on the left and a 5 on the right is a 45. 

**Attribute Modifier**: How far an attribute is above or below 10. For example, a Character with a Strong value of 15 would have a Strength Modifier of 5. Alternatively, with a value of 7 they would have a modifier of -3.
