# Terminology

You will need a **Game Master** (GM). A person who abides by the rules and remains entirely neutral in describing and adjudicating the game world. Though they carry great hope for the players at every step, they do nothing to sway fate, and allow the players to live and breathe in the game world as they will.

You will need at least one, and maybe many more **Players**. They will create characters and send them off to adventure in the game world. Those characters may attempt any action that can be imagined, and the GM will describe the outcome of that attempt. Said another way, the players act and the GM reacts.

You will need, lastly, some dice, which use the following notation:

**d4**: a four-sided die

**d6**: a six-sided die

**d8**: an eight-sided die

**d10**: a ten-sided die

**d12**: a twelve-sided die

**d20**: a twenty-sided die

There are a few ways that these will be rolled in the game, described as follows:
- A roll using multiple dice. Written as a number before the notation above. For example, 3d6 means to roll three six-sided dice and sum the results.
- A modified roll. Written as a plus or minus after the dice roll. For example, 2d4+1 means to roll two four-sided dice, sum the results, and add 1.
- A percent roll. Written as d100, this uses two ten-sided dice read left to right. For example, a roll of a 4 on the left and a 5 on the right is a 45. 

**Attribute Modifier**: How far an attribute is above or below 10. For example, a Character with a Strong value of 15 would have a Strength Modifier of 5. Alternatively, with a value of 7 they would have a modifier of -3.

**Success by X**: How far the result of a roll is below a target number. For example, if a skill is level 4, rolling a 1 would be success by 3.

Most actions while **Exploring** take place over a number of **Turns**, roughly 10 minutes each.

In moments of high intensity where more granularity is needed, the GM may **stop the clock** and instead move to **Segmented** mode.  
Each character present acts in order, with each action taking a **Segment**, usually a few seconds.  
The time it takes all characters in a situation to act out their **Segment** is one **Round**, usually one minute.

There can be any number of segments in a round, 10 rounds in a turn, 6 turns in an hour, and 24 hours in a day.  
Do not worry if these numbers are not exactly correct in the moment.  
It probably takes more than 10 minutes to disarm a complex mechanical trap through the narrow seam in a chest lid.  
It probably takes less than 10 minutes to get a torch out of a backpack and light it.  
Some acts will be obviously longer, some obviously shorter, but it will all balance in the end.

**X'** is used to denote a distance of roughly one square on a map. If you are using the imperial system, this is 10 feet. If you are using metric, this is 3 meters.  
5' = 50 feet, 15 meters, 5 squares

**1/1'** will usually be encountered as an ability cost, where it means 1 Corruption for every 1 square of distance.

No exceptions are intended to be made for diagonals. One square over followed by one square up or down is two squares, 20 feet.  
You may, of course, resolve diagonals however you wish. There are many theories and much more complex systems for doing so.  
Alternatively, you may use a hex grid. These options will not significantly change your experience, so use whatever feels best.
