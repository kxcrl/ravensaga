# Journeying
- Between moments of Exploration or Turn-Based action, hours or even an entire day may pass with only a few important things being narrated.
- Traveling long distances, crafting complex items, studying, training, or other periods where the actions of the characters do not vary during them should be passed over as montages.
- This will cause the quickest depletion of supplies, as well as the greatest number of potential encounters with any wandering danger that may be in the area. The GM should be sure to track and roll for both. 
- If there is any possibility of a situation requiring attention or careful interaction, no matter how small, the montage should stop.
