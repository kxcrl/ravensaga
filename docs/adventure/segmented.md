# Segmented
In situations of high danger or drama, every second counts.

- If a trap is unleashed, a weapon swung, an accusation made, or any other significant event where each moment could change the outcome of a scene, the GM should announce that they are **stopping the clock**.
- Each character will then be able to take one action, referred to as a **Segment**.
- All segments together compose a round.
- Segment order is determined by how Quick each character is, with higher values going first.
- Each player should declare their intention at the beginning of the round, which may add or subtract from their Quick value and may modify the order.

Mod | Action          | Description
----|-----------------|------------
 -  | Assist          | Give advantage to an ally's action, skipping your segment
+3  | Ready           | Stand up, unpack an item, draw or reload a weapon, raise a shield
+3  | Hasty Action    | Quickly act with disadvantage
 0  | Dash            | Move at full movement rate
 0  | Recover         | Attempt to remove a negative status
 0  | Standard Action | Use any skill or perform any action as normal
-3  | Slow Action     | Use any skill or action requiring a large, heavy, two-handed, or slow object
-3  | Ability         | Use any ability

**Movement**  
If acting on any segment other than Dash, a character may also move a distance equal to their lowest movement speed as part of their action.

**Using weaponry**  
Check Accurate Â± Defense to determine the target number  
Roll 1d20. Any amount below the number is damage, up to the weapon's maximum.  
If any number above is rolled, the attack fails to pierce the target's defense or misses.

**Moving in Range**  
If anything moves in range of a combatant, they can choose to make a free hasty attack, but they forfeit their next action if they do so.  
This includes actions that may happen next round if they have already acted.

**Hesitating**  
A character can choose to wait and act later in the current segment or in a later segment, instead

**Knocked Off-Guard**  
If a character takes more damage than their Pain Threshold, they are knocked off guard and must Ready as their next action

**Ties for Segment Order**
First, whoever is Quickest  
If Quick is tied, then whoever is most Vigilant  
If Vigilant is also tied, then whoever is most Discrete  
If Discrete is also tied, choose at random
