# Segmented
In situations of high danger or drama, every second counts.

- If a trap is unleashed, a weapon swung, an accusation made, or any other significant event where each moment could change the outcome of a scene, the GM should announce that they are **stopping the clock**.
- Actions proceed as rounds in which 10 segments occur in order.
- Each player should declare their intention at the beginning of the round and may not change it. Setting a d10 on a specific number in front of each player may help with this.


1. **Assist** - Give advantage to an ally's action later in the round
1. **Ready** - Stand up, unpack an item, or reload a weapon
1. **Dash** - Move at a character's full movement rate
1. **Hasty Action** - Quickly perform an action with disadvantage
1. **Recover** - Gain 2 HP
1. **Resist** - Attempt to remove an effect
1. **Standard Action** - Use any skill or perform any action as normal
1. **Slow Action** - Use any skill requiring a large, heavy, two-handed, or otherwise slow item
1. **Ability** - Use any ability
1. **Focused Action** Perform an action with advantage

**Movement**  
If acting on any segment other than Dash, a character may also move a distance equal to their lowest movement speed as part of their action.

**Using weaponry**  
Check Accurate Â± Defense to determine target number  
Roll 1d20, add any amount below the target number to base damage, subtract any above  

**Moving in Range**  
If anything moves in range of a combatant, they can choose to make a free hasty attack, but they forfeit their next action if they do so.  
This includes actions that may happen next round if they have already acted.

**Hesitating**  
A character can choose to wait and act later in the current segment or in a later segment, instead

**Knocked Off-Guard**  
If a character takes more damage than their Pain Threshold, they are knocked off guard and must Ready as their next action

**Turn Order Within Segments**  
First, whoever is Quickest  
If Quick is tied, then whoever is most Vigilant  
If Vigilant is also tied, then whoever is most Discrete  
If Discrete is also tied, choose at random
