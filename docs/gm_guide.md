# GM Guide

_I will let the torrent flow_  
_I will remember everything_  
_I will build a world from their actions_  
_I will be an architect_  
_I will be poetic_  
_I will be energetic_  
_I will lift them up, and vanish_  
_I will be a beacon of camaraderie_  
_I will be a terror to behold_  
_--The Oath of the Game Master, Index Card RPG_

What follows here is guidance for the various things you may encounter while in your group's sessions and how to reconcile them with the specific rules of Ravensaga.

The choice of the word "guide" here is intentional. While every other section has been extensively tested and is intended to be used as written, no map can accurately describe the territory of your table.  
The more specified it is, the further it would drift, and like a detailed drawing rendered in ink, the less adaptable it would be to what you need.

Searching for traps is a very different thing in the claustrophobic underground than it is in a wide and open forest.  
And what if the character is followed by an entire haunt of spirits with spectral vision? What if they are a skilled thief, but their avariciousness has left them warped with corruption? What if they have been transformed into something else?

These sections may serve as a starting point, but interpreting and adjudicating these scenarios is not only the joy, but the central reason for having a living, breathing human being at the head of the table.  
No one knows you, or your friends, or your world better than you do.  
Trust that implicitly.

Make of everything else what you will.
