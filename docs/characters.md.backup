# Characters

**Attributes**  
_That which makes up all those that strive._  
Accurate, Cunning, Discreet, Persuasive, Quick, Resolute, Strong, and Vigilant.  
They range from 3-18.
Roll 3d6 for each of them, in order.  


**Skills**  
_That which all can do, and in their so doing make the world._  
They are tested by rolling 1d6, succeeding if the result is equal or less.  
To gain them costs 10xp per rank. (10xp for level 1, then 20 more xp for level 2, for 30 total)  
You must find a teacher or another reasonable way by which you may learn or improve.  
They range from 1-5.  

**Abilities**  
_That which almost none can do, shared only by those that dedicate their lives._  
Rare, reality bending capacities that can destroy a character just through the attempt to gain them.  
Their use often invites corruption.  
They are learned from secret orders, ancient tomes, and lost artifacts.  
The xp cost varies, but is much higher than most skills.

**Traits**  
_The advantages and burdens that each carry through their journey._  
You have them or you donâ€™t.  
They may be gained through great and terrible deeds and only shed through the same.  
They have no cost and are added or removed from characters entirely through their interaction with the fiction.

**Rituals**  
_The sacred arts by whose careful application the world may be changed from afar._  
If known, can be performed over the course of an hour, requiring absolute concentration and the sacrifice of many different components.  
If on a scroll, can be performed once, destroying the scroll.  

**Convictions**  
_The core values by which all develop._  
Between two and four fundamental ways that a character behaves.  
By following their tenants, a character may gain 1, 2, or 5 xp.  
By outgrowing them, a character may conclude them for 10 xp. This removes the Conviction and the character can never take it or any like it again. It is usually made obvious in the story when and how this should occur.  

**Inventory**  
_The mediums of every act to come._  
A number of items that fill a backpack, are gripped in a hand, or rest upon the body.  
The amount that can be carried is determined by how Strong a character is, a base of 13 available slots with 1 more for every 2 points of strength above 3.  
As these slots fill, movement speed slows.  
A sack carried in two hands may double the available slots.  
Carried in one hand, it grants half as much.  
Packed items require a turn to dig out.  
Equipped items are available at a moment's notice, but only so many scabbards and quivers can be strapped to the body without causing a burden of their own.
