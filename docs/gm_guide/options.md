**Improvement with Practice**  
When making a skill check, if the character succeeds by rolling a 1, they may spend 10xp to immediately improve the skill.

**Improvement by Affinity**  
For every 5 skills a player possesses that all have the same attribute, they may improve that attribute by 1.  
It is recommended in this case to remove the Attribute Focus ability from the game.

**Predisposition**  
Since attributes quantify a character's backstory and their history with certain types of activities, a character might quickly pick up the basics of the things if they've had similar experiences.  
Things they have no experience with would be more difficult.  
The first level of each skill is 10xp Â± the modifier of its primary attribute.  
Subsequent levels are 10xp, as normal.

**Unaware Skill Checks**  
Occasionally, just rolling a skill check will give the player information as if it had succeeded. For instance, a player moves into a room and has to see if they are moving silently or hidden by shadows or is able to detect nearby traps.  
To keep things more surprising, the GM may make these rolls in secret as the players are moving and only share the results if there is a consequence.
